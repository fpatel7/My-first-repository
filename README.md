The TurtleScreen class defines graphics windows as a playground for the drawing turtles. It should be used when turtle is used as part of some application.
All methods of TurtleScreen/Screen also exist as functions, i.e. as part of the procedure-oriented interface. RawTurtle defines Turtle objects which draw on a TurtleScreen. Its constructor needs a Canvas, ScrolledCanvas or TurtleScreen as argument, so the RawTurtle objects know where to draw. Turtle is an inbuilt module in Python. It provides drawing using a screen (cardboard) and turtle (pen). To draw something on the screen, we need to move the turtle. To move turtle, there are some functions i.e forward(), backward(), etc.

In this code, we will see how to draw a smiling face using the Turtle module.
